# dynamic-pricing

This project provides a dynamic pricing recommendation system using advanced machine learning and big data analytics. The system takes into account local competition, customer reviews, seasonal trends, and other relevant factors. A user-friendly GUI is included for ease of use.

## **Key Features**
1. **Dynamic Pricing Suggestions**: 
   - Daily and weekly price recommendations based on competition and market conditions.
   - Incorporates factors like seasons, reviews, and external market data.

2. **Advanced Analytics**: 
   - Utilizes machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) for predictive and adaptive pricing.
   - Processes data from multiple APIs (e.g., review platforms, weather APIs for seasonality).

3. **Interactive GUI**: 
   - User-friendly interface built with Python libraries (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, or Streamlit).
   - Displays pricing suggestions, data visualizations, and historical trends.

4. **Big Data Integration**: 
   - Leverages large datasets to analyze competition and consumer behavior.
   - Includes data preprocessing pipelines for scalability.

## **System Requirements**
- **Python**: Version >= 3.8
- **Libraries**:
  - GUI: `streamlit` or `PyQt5`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
  - APIs: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4` (for scraping), `geopy` (for location data)
- **Optional Tools**:
  - Big data: `PySpark` or `Dask` for large-scale data processing.

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemangsharma/dynamic-pricing.git
   cd dynamic-pricing
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## **Usage**
1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab/Notebook.
   - Execute all cells to initialize the system.

2. **Interact with the GUI**:
   - Adjust input parameters such as location, season, and customer sentiment.
   - View pricing suggestions and analysis in real-time.

3. **Customize**:
   - Add new factors or APIs to enhance the analysis.
   - Train or fine-tune the ML model for specific datasets.

## **Brainstorming and Additional Suggestions**
1. **Data Sources**:
   - Use Google Places API or Yelp API to gather competitor pricing and reviews.
   - Integrate weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to account for seasonal demand changes.

2. **Machine Learning Techniques**:
   - **Regression Models**: Predict prices based on historical data.
   - **Clustering**: Identify patterns in local competition.
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Adapt pricing strategies dynamically based on feedback.

3. **GUI Enhancements**:
   - Add sliders for selecting price ranges and weights for factors.
   - Incorporate real-time graphs to visualize price trends and suggestions.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Use distributed data processing frameworks like Apache Spark for large datasets.
   - Store data in cloud services (e.g., AWS S3, Google BigQuery).

5. **Automation**:
   - Set up a cron job to fetch data and update recommendations automatically.
   - Send pricing suggestions via email or notifications.

6. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Implement metrics like revenue growth, occupancy rate, or market share to evaluate the pricing strategy.
